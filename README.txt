Program Description:
- Program starts by initializing a house and adding rooms to the house
- Each room has a list of rooms it is connected to and evidence that has been dropped inside the room
- The program will start by asking the user for the names of each of the hunters, and each will be given equipment to find one type of evidence
- All of the hunters start by being placed in the van, where the ghost can be anywhere in the house excluding the van
- The hunters while in the simulation can grow tired or scared of the ghost over time depending if they are in the same room as the ghost
- The hunters can take one of the following actions at a time: Move to a new room, check the room for evidence, or review the evidence that all the hunters have found
- The ghost while in the simulation can grow bored over time, or in the same room as the hunter where their borderm will reset 
- The ghost can take one of the following actions at a time: move to a new room, do nothing or drop evidence in the room they are in
- The hunters will leave if they either get scared or bored or have decided they have found enough evidence upon review
- The ghost will leave if they get bored
