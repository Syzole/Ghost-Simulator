Init is done: yay, keep an eye out for not init propley that may cause problems in the future, yooo this for future person readin this, yeah hi, uh this guy writing this had an idea for the rooms to have an int value to count how many hunters were in a given room at once, trust me its for the ghost to know if its all good to enter or not

Hunter actions:
First check if the hunter is in room with ghost, like if the pointers match for example hmmmmmmm ยบ _ ยบ

Then roll for the options:{
Look for evidence, log result of if found anything or nada
or
Move to another room, adjust pointers as needed
or 
Do a evCheck, asking them selves hmmmm is we good or do we need more (cause appernalty living is optional in this simulation)
}
then check if they is made scared or mad bored, and then dip if either apply

Ghost:
If a ghost is a room with hunter at start, no longer bored
else tick up by 1
Move to another room if it can, if not re roll(update da pointers kk?)
or
leave one of the three ev types it can drop(do u think the ghost just knocks a lamp and calls it a day?)

if the ghost is ever too bored he will also just dip, maybe check if we should do that first or not kinda important

and then print everything at the end saying all the stuff like hunters win yay or lose boo



This is the command line for testing and debuggin:
gcc -g -o test defs.h Ghost.c house.c logger.c main.c utils.c Hunter.c -lpthread


Swapping Devices: Two hunters can swap devices if they are in the same room.
Make sure to include semaphore locking so that no two hunters have the same device at a time outside
of a semaphore lock (i.e., neither can perform an operation during a swap). In your README, specify
where this swapping occurs so the TA can easily verify the bonus mark.
